Data mining and knowledge discovery from social media:

Implementation data analysis methods on data collection from Twitter

## About

In this repository lives the source code of a try to
- grabbing and storage tweets  from Twitter's streaming API
- clustering any corpus of tweets (unsupervised)
- exporting matters subject to these and
- counting the efficacy of my machine learning efforts.

Also in code there exist a solution for the removing duplicates documents from collection (retweets problem).

This material constituted the implemented part of my Bachelor Dissertation.
